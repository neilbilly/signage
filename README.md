Signage
=======

Signage broadcaster built on Node.js

### Signage files
Signage files can be held locally in /public/signage or on a remote site. The files should be HTML partial files, i.e. HTML without <HEAD> and <BODY> tags as their contents are pushed to clients and injected into the clients DOM.
